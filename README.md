# Spam-Detection-System-using-Naive-Bayes-and-LSTM
This project focuses on developing an accurate and efficient spam detection system using machine learning algorithms and text preprocessing techniques. Trained on a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam (ham) text messages, the system learns to identify patterns and features that differentiate the two classes.
